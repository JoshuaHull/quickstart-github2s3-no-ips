The Quick Start provides an Amazon API Gateway endpoint, several Lambda functions and an AWS CodeBuild project to handle the download, zipping, and deployment of code to Amazon S3. AWS CodePipeline carries a cost for each active pipeline; see https://aws.amazon.com/codepipeline/pricing/[AWS CodePipeline pricing]. Depending on your configuration, the Quick Start may deploy an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key; for pricing, see https://aws.amazon.com/kms/pricing/[AWS Key Management Service pricing]. API Gateway, Amazon S3, Lambda, and AWS CodeBuild costs vary depending on how often you commit code to your repository; each commit triggers a request to the Lambda execution in API Gateway; for details, see the pricing pages for https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/pricing/[API Gateway], https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/[Amazon S3], https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/[Lambda] and https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/pricing/[codebuild] .
